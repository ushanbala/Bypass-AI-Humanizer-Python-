# AI Bypass (Humanizer) using Python and NLP

This project provides a Python-based tool to "humanize" text generated by artificial intelligence. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to modify AI-generated content, making it sound more natural and less robotic.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for ethical purposes, such as understanding the nuances of AI-generated text and exploring ways to improve its naturalness. Misusing this tool to misrepresent AI-generated content as human-written work is unethical and potentially harmful.

## Overview

The goal of this humanizer is to take text produced by AI models and apply various NLP transformations to make it resemble human writing more closely. This typically involves:

* **Synonym Replacement:** Replacing words with their synonyms to introduce variety and avoid repetitive phrasing.
* **Sentence Restructuring:** Slightly altering sentence structure while preserving the original meaning.
* **Adding Natural Language Elements:** Incorporating interjections, transitional phrases, or idiomatic expressions (use with caution to avoid unnatural results).
* **Adjusting Tone and Style:** Making subtle changes to word choice and phrasing to shift the perceived tone.

**Note:** The effectiveness of any "humanizer" is limited, and sophisticated AI detection tools may still be able to identify manipulated text.

## Features (Planned/Potential)

* Basic synonym replacement using WordNet (via NLTK).
* Randomized application of transformations to avoid predictable patterns.
* Options to control the level of "humanization."
* Potential integration of more advanced NLP techniques like paraphrasing models (may require additional dependencies and API access).
* Simple command-line interface (CLI) for easy use.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `nltk` library

You can install the necessary library using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
