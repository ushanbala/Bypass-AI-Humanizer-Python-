# AI Bypass (Humanizer) using Python NLP with a Tkinter GUI

This project provides a Python-based tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter to "humanize" text generated by artificial intelligence. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to modify AI-generated content, aiming to make it sound more natural and less robotic.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for ethical purposes, such as understanding the nuances of AI-generated text and exploring ways to improve its naturalness. Misusing this tool to misrepresent AI-generated content as human-written work is unethical and potentially harmful.

## Overview

This humanizer application offers a user-friendly interface to take text produced by AI models and apply various NLP transformations to make it resemble human writing more closely. The Tkinter GUI allows for easy input of AI-generated text and display of the humanized output. The core functionality relies on NLP techniques such as:

* **Synonym Replacement:** Replacing words with their synonyms to introduce variety and avoid repetitive phrasing.
* **Sentence Restructuring:** Slightly altering sentence structure while preserving the original meaning.
* **Adding Natural Language Elements:** Incorporating interjections, transitional phrases, or idiomatic expressions (use with caution to avoid unnatural results).
* **Adjusting Tone and Style:** Making subtle changes to word choice and phrasing to shift the perceived tone.

**Note:** The effectiveness of any "humanizer" is limited, and sophisticated AI detection tools may still be able to identify manipulated text.

## Features

* **Tkinter-based Graphical User Interface:** Provides an intuitive way to interact with the humanizer.
* **Input Text Area:** Allows users to paste or type AI-generated text.
* **Humanized Output Area:** Displays the processed, "humanized" text.
* **Basic Synonym Replacement:** Utilizes WordNet (via NLTK) to find and replace words with synonyms.
* **Customization Options (Planned/Potential):**
    * Control the level of synonym replacement.
    * Options to enable/disable specific humanization techniques.
* **Progress Indication (Planned/Potential):** Provide feedback during the processing.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `tkinter` (standard library - no need to install separately)
* `nltk` library

You can install the `nltk` library using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
